RPi Simple I/O

There are two modus and a demo program. One module deals with talking to the i2c chips using smBus, and the second handles running a simulation on the RPi screen using pygame. The program is a simple traffic lights demo. The simulation will run without the I/O board connected (and with it).

This is all to demonstrate the concept. These are not polished programs and would be need to be clearer and more robust to use in teaching.
